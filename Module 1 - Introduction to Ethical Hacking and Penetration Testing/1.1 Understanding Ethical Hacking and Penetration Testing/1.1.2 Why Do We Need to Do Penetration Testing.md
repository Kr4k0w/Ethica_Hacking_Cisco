Penetration testing is crucial because it helps organizations identify potential security weaknesses before attackers do. Even though various defensive technologies, such as antivirus, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and anti-malware, are in place, it's essential to assess whether these defenses are sufficient to protect valuable assets.

Key reasons for penetration testing:

- **Validate Defenses**: It evaluates if the security measures, such as firewalls, IPS, and anti-malware, are effectively protecting the network or system.
- **Assess Protection of Valuable Assets**: Penetration tests help determine if the most critical assets are being adequately protected.
- **Adapt to Changes**: As networks and systems evolve, the attack surface may change, and regular penetration testing ensures the security posture is continuously monitored and reinforced.

In summary, penetration testing helps ensure that defenses are effective, sufficient, and adaptive to potential threats and evolving infrastructures.
